"These convenient tetra paks of Vita (""life"" in Italian) Coco Coconut Water WITH Pineapple is a smart and easy way to rehydrate! I lose a lot of electrolytes (sodium and potassium) and this little pak is ""paked"" with them! I used to drink Gatorade for the same purpose of hydrating, and they took up a lot of space inside my refrigerator. But not these! I just bought two boxes of these and am now ready to buy two more!!!",15 Aug 2012,Hydration Never Tasted and Felt so Good!,5.0 ,A. Williams

"As I mentioned in my review for Vitacoco's coconut water with acai & pomegranate, I recently discovered this product at a local market and enjoyed it as a way to rehydrate after a hot day on the golf course. According to the label, coconut water has more potassium than a banana and of all the flavors, the pineapple is easily my favorite. Found it for a good price on Amazon and ordered it by the case. It shipped quickly and without problem. Will definitely be buying again...",17 Sep 2009,Best coconut water on the market...,5.0 ,Rod Wms

The person that said there is no Pineapple in the Pineapple flavored Coconut water is probably eating something super sweet b4 drinking it. AMAZINGLY WONDERFUL. I was lovin the plain. The I tried the pineapple and it was so good I went out and bought a bottle of Knudsons Organic Pineapple juice to blend with my 12 Liters of plain I bought. But the Pineapple blend direct from Vita Coco is the absolute BEST.,14 Feb 2011,WOW EXcellent Taste Not too sweet but wonderful,5.0 ,DAC
"An excellent refreshing pick me up - especially after exercising. It is best served over ice. I tried it as a mixer for an alcoholic drink and it totally did not work. The fruit flavor is light versus heavy and the coconut flavor really comes through even though this is coconut ""water"" versus the heavier coconut ""milk"". The one downside is the package comes with no straw so you must have a sharp clean object handy to penetrate the seal.",23 Apr 2013,excellent fruit and coconut beverage for those who love both,5.0 ,Sharon L.

I got hooked on VitaCoco buying it on accident once and it is delicious. I like the Peach Mango flavor the best. On my vacation to the Caribbean Islands I got to try different ideas from the natives and found that green coconut water was good for hangovers and brown coconut water was good for constipation. Well VitaCoco falls into the hangover category. In fact I find that using VitaCoco as an alcohol mixer works great to balance out the equation.,24 Jun 2010,I love it!,5.0 ,TQ

"I normally use these after my Bikram yoga class but they are great after any workout. They are a bit high in calories so I try to limit to after a tough workout but they taste great and I highly recommend them.

"So great for hydration for those who are athletic and need a healthy alternative to sugary ""electrolyte"" drinks...you know what I am talking about. :-) My only complaint is that I cannot drink the plain coconut water by itself due to the flavor, so it goes into pancake mix or protein smoothies as it takes on the flavor of what it is mixed with.

"This tastes like a very watery pina colada, which, after a workout and you need to rehydrate, is a good thing. Children probably wouldn't like it, mine don't, but I do like a nice cold Coconut Water after working out. I don't like bananas, which is the way a lot of people get their potassium, so I drink one of these each day to get some of what I'm lacking. My only complaint is that I wish it came with a straw attached like most juice boxes do.

"I got this during a Gold Box deal, but the price is good even without that deal. I found that I was drinking a lot of VitaCoco and it was more cost effective to order a 12-pack online than keep buying single ones.

"I'm trying to make some healthy choices and coconut water over soda is one of them, but they sure don't make it easy. This stuff isn't good. Actually, it's rather yucky, but it's healthier than pop/soda, so I'm committed. The pineapple is probably the best I've tasted, but that's not saying much. I love pineapple and this stuff almost makes me hate it, but not quite. I will keep drinking it though, because I don't like what soda does to me.

"Drinking fresh coconut water is commonplace in Miami, where growing up, you could easily find roadside vendors selling ""Coco Frio"". They take a coconut, give it a couple of well-placed cuts with a machete to cut open a small notch on one end, insert a straw, and bingo! You're enjoying a great, natural, and healthy drink. This product is probably the closest you'll get to duplicating that fresh taste, plus it has the additional benefit of mango & peach puree giving it an additional flavor boost. Plus, it's got electrolytes.",17 Jul 2013,Almost as good as fresh Coco Frio,5.0 ,Jonathan Meola
"As with any type of food, I guess, whether you like it or not is a matter of taste. I enjoy the taste of this drink, but I think I would not have when I was a child or a teen, but my taste buds then liked heavily processed foods and beverages that were full of sugar and/or artificial ingredients. Over the years I have come to enjoy eating and drinking more healthy foods that are not always the one that can be found at a convenience store or at a fast food place. Anyway, the one factor that surprised me is that even though the drinks come in a juice box type container that even has writing on it that says ""it is like sticking a straw in a coconut,"" yet there are no attached straws. Anyway, one more positive comment is that that shipping was very fast.",10 Mar 2012,"I enjoy it, but...no straw?",4.0 ,PhotosTexas
"Consciously, I feel very healthy when I drink Vita Coco. I drink 1/2 container every day and it seems to help with aches and pains and head aches. This isn't one of my favorite flavors but I like it. The only problem that I have with it (and I used to use auto ship) is that the price keeps increasing. Also, I wish the shippers would make up their mind. Sometimes it ships in the manufacturers box and sometimes they put it into another box.

I was a little apprehensive about ordering these from Amazon because of comments that the product tasted sour or spoiled.

"This isn't something you drink for pleasure - at least I don't. I drink it because it's supposed to be good for me, and because I'm trying to cut out soda. The peach & mango is way better than the plain or the tropical, but it's still not something I can honestly say I enjoy. I'll keep drinking it though, because I keep reading things that say it will do me good, and I don't want to keep drinking soda like I do. It's better to drink this when it's really cold, and it's easier if you drink it really fast.",09 Apr 2012,It's not horrible.,3.0 ,Yankee
"Love the convenience of having these babies delivered to my doorstep via the Amazon stork. The problem, as you can see above, is the price. The 11.1-ounce container will last you about 3 gulps, especially after a long run, tennis match, etc., so I always have to caution myself not to drink two dollars away in two seconds when I'm too thirsty. Um, but should I really have to do that? Maybe I'm too poor (cheap). The truly annoying part about the price is that it fluctuates dramatically. I've paid as low as $13, and as high as $20, and guess what? It's just not very exciting to pay the $20 after getting it for $13. $20 is a reasonably good deal for the 16-ounce size, but too much for these gulp-unfriendly versions.",19 Sep 2013,"Head-clearing, hydrating, and, yes, hella-expensive",4.0 ,10s Reader

"A rather disappointing product. Quite flavorless with no discernible coconut flavor at all. A weak pineapple flavor is all I tasted. So disappointing, that I have no desire to try another Pak.

If you're like me you really enjoy the all around effects of vita coco but you're not really keen on the taste then I suggest you try another flavor this one tastes really similar to the original.

"Wow you either love or hate this product...I love it...but I had to play with it to find the right way to drink it, you may wonder what that means. Well I love peach & mango drinks & love coconut water anyway....but this product has to be VERY VERY cold to be at its best or it taste like a pasty product. I find that if you let it get just a bit frozen like a soft slurpee/slushee it is really good or just very very cold will work. I have seen some ppl post very negative remarks on here & think some may be exaggerating just a bit & some may not really know what to expect from a drink like this...nothing wrong with that just dont be so dramatic about it really. One thing I have found a GREAT use for this with is Jamba Juice now sells frozen packs of it tops selling smoothies in stores now, so I like to buy my favorite Mango a go go & use the mango/peach coconut juice to blend the smoothie instead of using the apple juice that it calls for...you could use any of the vita water favors to mix with any of the flavors.

"I grew up in the tropics and had a lot of coconut water and mangos while growing up. I was excited to get this version of Vita's excellent coconut water. I opened one of the containers and took a swig immediately as I opened the box. Ugh! The mango aftertaste in this drink is the worst of the different mango flavors. It overpowers both the coconut and peach flavors. I can't even taste the peach in the drink. I let it chill to see if the aftertaste would go away, but was not so lucky. The flavor that overpowers everything is what you get when you leave the peeled mango out in the open for a day or two. It's way past ripe going to starting to get rancid. I put several other containers in the fridge to chill. I got the same results. It's a bummer because I was looking forward to drinking it. The version with pineapple is much much better than this one. I still like the straight coconut water drink the best.

Maybe the most noticeable thing is how much more ""hydrated"" I feel after drinking it. I work 12 hour shifts as an RN and this really helps as I often am too busy to drink as much as I should.

I love this! It Is alittle sugary and tart. I like to mix it with pure coconut water if the same brand. It taste great! This is also a great brand that isn't from concentrate and in my research they do use a medium temp for pasteurize for 5 sec.

I am currently battling a potassium deficiency problem and in the past year have drank a ton of V-8 for the high potassium. At first I didn't mind this because I love Bloody Mary's but after 9 months I can barely get a small can of V-8 down and I am not a big fan of banannas. I saw this add on Facebook for Coconut Water and saw that it has the same amount of potassium as V-8. I bought a pack and have been drinking it for about a week. According the the reviews the pineapple seemed to be a big hit so I went with that. It tastes exactly like you would imagine a mixture of coconut and pineapple. I can't say I'm in love with it but it is 100% better than choking down the V-8. I have actually drank this every night after my workout for the hydration and potassium benefits. I will probably re-order as I haven't been able to find this in the local stores.,18 Mar 2012,Coco Water with Pineapple,4.0 ,Kellie Collins
"I tried the lemonade style and and it just doesn't do it. It needs sugar -- it just tastes like a sour lemon squeezed into coconut water, which I could make at home for a lot less money. In fact, I think I will! Edit: i realized I do not like drinking out of these paper-type containers. When i finally poured the liquid into a glass, and over ice, it tasted much better. I'll bump it up to 4 stars from 3.",12 Sep 2016,not as good as it sounds; better over ice,4.0 ,Eden Elizabeth
"If you love coconut water, you'll love this flavor! Super refreshing and hydrating. The flavor is delicious and I like it much better than just plain coconut water. The flavor tastes natural and doesn't taste artificial at all. I would definitely buy again.",15 Mar 2019,Delicious!,5.0 ,Amanda
"The first time I ordered the Vita Coco, I got the plain flavor. The second time, I ordered this in 2-packs of 12. The flavor was the one I ordered, but it was spoiled (sour). I saved the lot numbers and info as both were the same batch and I had to discard it as it was not safe for me to give this to my disabled husband who usually benefits from the super-hydration properties of this product. We were very disappointed and surprised that this would happen.",16 Nov 2014,We were very disappointed and surprised that this would happen,1.0 ,Happy Amazon customer
"After two rounds of chemo, my system was shot. Couldn't keep sodium and potassium levels up, nor prescribed supplements and meds down. Found SmartWater and it was helpful, but missed things that tasted good (which, buy the way, also help to incourage an appetite). There are now many types of coconut water on the market these days, and of the many brands and flavors available, Vita Coco Coconut Water with Pineapple, 11.1-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12) is by far my favorite. Buying bulk also gets the most for my money. This size fits easily in purse or car glovebox (though I like it best chilled).",04 Jul 2012,Terrific electrolyte replacement,5.0 ,Melissa Rivers
"I love coconut water and I love mango and I love peach. I was so disappointed when I got this drink. My friend had tried warning me and he was right. The fruit flavor is so overpowering that it tastes artificial with a chemical aftertaste. I cannot drink it. I had a case of twelve and, rather than waste it, I tried it watered down in a smoothie. It was awful. I could not even drink it. I wish I could give it negative 100 stars.",05 Sep 2018,Awful Artificial After Taste,1.0 ,Lauren Kretzer
"Love This! I’ve bought this multiple times from Amazon, and every time the item has arrived fully sealed up and in its own box for added safety. I Will continue to purchase this from amazon, Some might find the taste a little too sweet and I would agree, so I highly recommend adding a pinch of Pink Himalayan Salt To each bottle before drinking it, I find it balances out the flavors quite nicely and it taste amazing.",18 Oct 2018,Love It!,5.0 ,jennifer
"I have tried a few different brands of coconut water and this is by far my favorite. Anyone that's disappointed in the flavor has probably never tried coconut water before, as it has a VERY faint flavor. You should not expect this to taste like a sugary juice. This particular brand, the pineapple version specifically, is the most flavorful (and delicious) kind that I've tried. It's definitely best when very cold, so wait for it to chill before you drink it! I had to put this on subscription!",01 Mar 2013,Delicious!,5.0 ,Shannon

"Delicious, lots of potassium to keep you hydrated, tastes great with the pineapple flavor that gives the coconut taste more of a tang.

"I think I taste more of the mango then the peach but over all I like the Vita Coco water with flavors then just by itself. I am not in the food science world but I think Coconut water is made by taking the coconut milk and separating the cream/ solids from the water part. What is left is a strong coconut flavored past that is sent somewhere else and coconut water that still has health effects and a very slight coconut flavor. It also has some weight, or thickness that is heaver then what normal water would be, it reminds me of an egg white viscosity. Drink it colder the better I say because when warm urp!",13 Sep 2012,hmm ok,4.0 ,Sven the Educated

"I like most of the products by vita-coco. However, I do not like the taste of this at all. Very bitter. It tastes just like lemon juice concentrate from one of those plastic lemon juice bottles mixed with coconut water. Not sweet at all. Just bitter. These flavors do not mix well. I'm sticking with the pineapple flavor.",31 Jul 2018,Bitter,2.0 ,Steve R
"I find plain coconut water to be a little unpalatable. It's an acquired taste that I have a hard time acquiring. With pineapple, I absolutely adore it. It only adds about 15g of sugar (so, two teaspoons, not too bad) but makes the taste really really enjoyable. When I do use coconut water I have a lot less soreness after my lifting sessions. I also just -feel- better. I strongly recommend this product to anyone who is active and may have tried coconut water in the past only to make a face and pass it on to someone else. Plus, the price per unit is marvelous on Amazon.",13 Aug 2012,Soreness begone!,5.0 ,Areta
"I feel like straight coconut water is an acquired taste, but these peach mango ones are just delicious. They aren't too sweet and the mix of peach and mango is more of an accent than a dominant set of flavors. The result is a cool, refreshing beverage in what i consider to be the perfect container size. Where i live, these are priced individually at an average of $1.79, which would be around $21.50 for a twelve pack. So, for the current subscribe & save price of $17.65, you are saving around $4 here on Amazon (if you would have purchased twelve anyway that is). Great taste, competitive price. I am glad to have found these here.",10 Mar 2012,Clean and tasty beverage.,5.0 ,Peter Faden

"I used to buy cases of Gatorade for my boys during their sport seasons, until I read about the ingredients in those types of products. Last track season, I stopped off at the Whole Foods store before hurrying to my son's district track meet. I grabbed him some ProBars and a couple bottles of VitaCoco Pure Coconut Water. When I handed them to him, he looked at me like I had gone nuts, but what he said to me after his event sold me forever. He said, ""Mom, I felt better during this race than I ever have before! I felt like I was flying, with energy to spare! I could run it all over again!"" I've decided to keep healthy fruit and nut based protein bars and coconut water around from now on! I will admit, though, that neither of my sons actually ""likes"" the taste of it. They think it tastes funny, but I figure it's because of the sugary ""electrolyte"" drinks they've become accustomed to. Since I won't be buying that anymore, they'll either have to get used to this, or just drink water!",18 Apr 2014,I'll never buy Gatorade again!,5.0 ,Pcowles

"This is my favorite of the Vita flavors (coconut water with peach & mango). I recommend you drink all the coconut waters chilled.
